**Why These Packages Are Excluded:**

1. **GPU/CUDA Packages**: Require NVIDIA GPU hardware and CUDA runtime which don't exist on mobile devices
2. **Windows-Only Packages**: Use Windows-specific APIs (Win32, COM, etc.) not available on iOS/Android
3. **Deprecated Packages**: Outdated packages that have been superseded or abandoned
4. **Other Non-Mobile**: Packages with Intel-specific optimizations, subprocess requirements, or other incompatibilities

**For Mobile Development**: Use pure Python packages or packages with official iOS/Android binary wheels instead.
